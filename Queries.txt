1. MakeReservation - Rest API does not have flight departure date. Find flight requires flightNumber and departureDate as flightNumber is
 only part primary key.
2. MakeReservation - What should be the order of the flights in comma separated flightNumbers ?
    Can we take the sequence of flights as given in request param or do we have to write our own logic to determine the sequence of
    flights and there by origin and destination or reservation ?
3. MakeReservation - If flightNumbers are assumed to in proper sequence, should we consider First flight Departure as Origin and Last flight Arrival as Destination ?
A = SJC - LAX
B = LAX - DFW
C = DFW - JFK
4. MakeReservation - Should we ignore a flight if it doesn't exist ? as it only requires 1 flight.
Ans: No. Error with flight does not exist. Similar with passenger.
